This is an example of an NXT robot going forward as long as it
senses white floor. If the color changes, it stops, goes back, turns left
and then continues forward.

This is done in a loop forever.

To compile you need to first have the nbc compiler.
To send the file to the NXT you need the nxtcom program.

You can download these from:
http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nbc/

If you are on OSX or linux, the simplest thing to do is to place the the nbc and nxtcom program
in your /usr/bin directory.

Go to the directory of your program, then:

To compile:
nbx -O=file_name.nxe source_file_name.nxc

To send the file to the NXT:
nxtcom -U file_name.nxe
